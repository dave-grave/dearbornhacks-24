   a. One approved math course
   b. EECS 203 or equivalent
   c. EECS 280
3. Academic Good Standing

MATH REQUIREMENTS:
Two math courses from different categories:
a. Calculus I: MATH 115, 120, 185, 295
b. Calculus II: MATH 116, 121, 156, 186, 276, 296
c. Linear Algebra: MATH 214, 217, 417, 419
d. Multivariable Calculus: MATH 205, 215, 285
e. Differential Equations: MATH 216, 286, 316

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:
1. CS Core Courses:
   - Second approved math course
   - EECS 281, 370, 376
   - Probability & Statistics: STATS 250, DATASCI 101, STATS 280, STATS 412, STATS 426, EECS 301, EECS 401, ECON 451, IOE 265, or TO 301
2. Upper Level CS Technical Electives (ULCS): 15 credits
   - At least 12 credits from ULCS list
   - Remaining 3 credits can be from Expanded ULCS list
3. Capstone Course: Approved EECS CS Capstone course

MAJOR GRADING & REPEAT POLICIES:
- C or better required in all major courses
- 200-level courses (EECS 203, 280, 281) limited to two attempts

CHOOSING BACHELOR OF ARTS (B.A.) OR BACHELOR OF SCIENCE (B.S.):
- B.S. requires 60 credits from physical/natural sciences or mathematics
- B.A. does not have this requirement
- Most CS-LSA majors reach B.S. threshold with 55 credits in Sample Schedule
- B.A. offers more flexibility for non-STEM courses
- Both degrees are equally valued by employers and graduate schools

CS HONORS PROGRAM:
- Open to LSA students completing CS B.S. degree
- Requirements: 3.5 GPA in CS major, complete EECS 443, write thesis, 3.4 overall UM GPA

SAMPLE SCHEDULE:
[Detailed 8-semester plan provided in the document]

COURSE PLANNING ADVICE:
- EECS 203 & 280: Often taken simultaneously
- EECS 281: Take as soon as possible (gateway course)
- Workload categories: Extremely heavy, Heavy, Moderate, Light
- Limit to 2 CS courses per semester recommended

CS-LSA TRACKS (OPTIONAL):
1. Artificial Intelligence
2. Data and Information
3. Economics and Computation
4. Robotics and Vision
5. Security
6. Software Development
7. Software Systems
8. Theory of Computation

DEPARTMENTAL OPPORTUNITIES:
- Research
- Teaching (Instructional Aid)
- Mentoring (Peer Advisor)
- Student Groups
- Internships and Job Opportunities

GPA CALCULATION:
Include all EECS courses, CS Program Core, ULCS, Capstone, and approved Stats requirement. Minimum 2.0 GPA required for graduation.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN B.A. AND B.S. DEGREES:
1. Credit Distribution:
   - B.S.: Requires 60 credits from physical/natural sciences or mathematics
   - B.A.: No specific credit distribution requirement for STEM courses
2. Flexibility:
   - B.S.: More structured, focuses on STEM courses
   - B.A.: Offers more flexibility for non-STEM courses and interdisciplinary studies
3. Career Implications:
   - Both degrees are equally valued by most employers
   - B.S. may be preferred for certain technical or research-oriented positions
   - B.A. may be advantageous for roles requiring broader skill sets
4. Graduate School:
   - Both degrees suitable for graduate studies in Computer Science
   - B.S. may have slight advantage for STEM-focused graduate programs
   - B.A. may be preferred for interdisciplinary graduate programs
5. Curriculum Focus:
   - B.S.: Emphasizes depth in scientific and mathematical concepts
   - B.A.: Allows for broader exploration of liberal arts alongside CS
6. Typical Student Profile:
   - B.S.: Students focused primarily on technical aspects of CS
   - B.A.: Students interested in combining CS with other disciplines
7. Degree Completion:
   - B.S.: Most CS-LSA students naturally complete B.S. requirements
   - B.A.: Requires intentional planning to balance CS with other interests
